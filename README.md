# Beginner Python Projects

A collection of beginner-level Python projects I am building as I learn programming and move towards my goal of becoming an AI developer.

## 1. Python Console Calculator

A simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers and runs in a loop until the user exits.

**Features:**

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Input validation for non-numeric values
- Handles division by zero
- Menu-based interface

**What I practised:**

- `input()` and number conversion
- Functions
- `if / elif / else` and loops
- Basic error handling

**Code:**  
`calculator.py` in the `Python-calculator` repository

## 2. Escape the AI Lab – Text-Based Adventure Game

A small text-based adventure game where the player must escape from an AI research lab by making choices in different scenes.

**Features:**

- Multiple scenes/rooms (door, air vent, computer, server room)
- Different endings (win / game over)
- Riddle/password check on the computer
- Option to play again without restarting the program

**What I practised:**

- Breaking logic into multiple functions
- Branching story paths with `if / elif / else`
- Using loops to control the game flow
- Handling user input and simple validation

**Code:**  
`adventure_game.py` in the `Python-adventure-game` repository
